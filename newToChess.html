        <p>
          Chess is a two-player game played on a board of 64 squares, with each
          player starting with 16 pieces. The aim of the game is to put your
          opponent's king in checkmate, which means the king is under attack and
          cannot escape capture on the next move. Here's how to play:
          <br /><br />
          The board is set up so that each player has a row of eight pawns in
          front of them, and their other pieces are placed behind the pawns. The
          pieces are as follows: each player has one king, one queen, two rooks,
          two knights, and two bishops. The player with the white pieces goes
          first. They move one of their pieces to a different square on the
          board, following the rules for that particular piece. The other player
          then moves one of their pieces, and so on, with each player taking
          turns. Each piece moves in a different way. Here's a quick summary of
          each piece's movement: <br /><br />
          <b>Pawns:</b> Move forward one or two squares on their first move, and
          one square forward on subsequent moves. They can only capture
          diagonally. <br /><br />
          <b>Rooks:</b> Move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Knights:</b> Move in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and
          then one square perpendicular to that. <br /><br />
          <b>Bishops:</b> Move any number of squares diagonally. <br /><br />
          <b>Queen:</b> Move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or
          diagonally. <br /><br />
          <b>King:</b> Move one square in any direction. If a player's piece
          lands on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, they capture that
          piece and remove it from the board. The game continues until one
          player's king is in checkmate, or if the game is a draw for some other
          reason.

        <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
        <p>
          1. Check occurs when the king is attacked by an opposing piece.
          <br /><br />
          2. Checkmate occurs when the king is in check and there is no legal
          move to get out of check. <br /><br />
          3. Stalemate occurs when the player whose turn it is to move has no
          legal move, but their king is not in check. <br /><br />
          4. Castling is a move where the king and rook are moved
          simultaneously, with the king moving two squares towards the rook and
          the rook moving to the square over which the king crossed.
          <br /><br />
          5. En passant is a capture that can occur when a pawn moves two
          squares on its first move and ends up next to an opposing pawn.
          <br /><br />
          6. Promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank and
          can be replaced with a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. <br /><br />7.
          The game can end in a draw if the same position is repeated three
          times or if no capture or pawn move has occurred in the last 50 moves.
          <br /><br />
          8. Touch-move rule: If a player touches a piece, they must move it if
          it is a legal move. If they touch an opposing piece, they must capture
          it if it is a legal move. <br /><br />
          9. Illegal moves result in a penalty, such as adding time to the
          opponent's clock or forfeiting the game.
