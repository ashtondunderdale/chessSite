        <p>
          Chess is a two-player game played on a board of 64 squares, with each
          player starting with 16 pieces. The aim of the game is to put your
          opponent's king in checkmate, which means the king is under attack and
          cannot escape capture on the next move. Here's how to play:
          <br /><br />
          The board is set up so that each player has a row of eight pawns in
          front of them, and their other pieces are placed behind the pawns. The
          pieces are as follows: each player has one king, one queen, two rooks,
          two knights, and two bishops. The player with the white pieces goes
          first. They move one of their pieces to a different square on the
          board, following the rules for that particular piece. The other player
          then moves one of their pieces, and so on, with each player taking
          turns. Each piece moves in a different way. Here's a quick summary of
          each piece's movement: <br /><br />
          <b>Pawns:</b> Move forward one or two squares on their first move, and
          one square forward on subsequent moves. They can only capture
          diagonally. <br /><br />
          <b>Rooks:</b> Move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Knights:</b> Move in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and
          then one square perpendicular to that. <br /><br />
          <b>Bishops:</b> Move any number of squares diagonally. <br /><br />
          <b>Queen:</b> Move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or
          diagonally. <br /><br />
          <b>King:</b> Move one square in any direction. If a player's piece
          lands on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, they capture that
          piece and remove it from the board. The game continues until one
          player's king is in checkmate, or if the game is a draw for some other
          reason.
