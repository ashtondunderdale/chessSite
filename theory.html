          <h3>Pawn Chains</h3>
          <p>
            In chess, pawn chains are an important aspect of pawn structures. A
            pawn chain is a formation of pawns on adjacent files that supports
            each other in a diagonal line. The pawns in a chain can move forward
            together and create a solid structure that can control the center of
            the board. This structure can be used for defensive purposes or as a
            platform for a strategic attack. <br /><br />
            Understanding the different types of pawn chains and their
            characteristics is crucial in chess. By recognizing the strengths
            and weaknesses of each chain, players can make informed decisions on
            their pawn moves and use these structures to their advantage.

            Here is an example of a pawn chain. We can see that white has an
            active pain chain protecting the king, this is because each pawn is
            protectec by another. It offers may defensive and offensive
            opportunities, for example, if blacks f6 pawn attacks whites e5
            pawn, then whites f4 pawn can take the now black e5 pawn. On the
            other hand if white decideds to use its e5 pawn to take blacks f6
            pawn then black has nothing to defend it and white has won material.
