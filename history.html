        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          Lets start from the beginning, the <i>very</i> beginning, tracing back
          around <b>1500</b> years, to the <i>6th centruy CE</i>, in India. At
          this time the game was known as <b>'chaturanga'</b>, which means 'four
          divisions' in Snaskrit. Chaturanga was played on an 8x8 board and had
          four different types of pieces: the elephant, the horse, the chariot,
          and the foot soldiers. These pieces represented the different units in
          the Indian army, with the elephant being the strongest piece and the
          foot soldiers being the weakest. Over time, chaturanga spread to other
          parts of the world, including Persia ( modern-day Iran ), where the
          game was modified to be known as <b>"shatranj"</b>. The rules of
          shatranj were similar to that of chaturanga, howeer the pieces were
          renamed and reorganised. ( this version may seem a bit more familiar
          ), The elephant became the bishop, the horse became the knight, the
          chariot became the rook, and the foot soldiers became the pawns. From
          Persia, shatranj sread to the islamic world, where it became a popular
          game among scholars and nobles. The game then arrived in Europe, where
          it underwent further modifications and eventually became known as
          <b>'Chess'.</b>

        <h2>Modern-Day Chess</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Now, the interesting stuff..</i> <br />
          <br />
          The best Chess players, <i>or player</i>, of all time.
          <b>Garry Kasparov</b> was <i>a</i>, possily <i>the</i>, most famous
          Chess player of all time, who dominated the game throughout the 1980s,
          and 1990s. Kasparov became the youngest ever undisputed
          <i>World Chess Champion</i> in 1985 at the age of 22, and held the
          title for 15 years, with a FIDE rating of 2851 in his prime ( a way of
          measuring the level of skill in Chess ). <br /><br />
          Now, sure Kasparov was undoubtedly one of the <i>great</i> greats of
          all time, but there is a lot of speculation around who the best Chess
          player of all time actually is, however its not as easy as just
          looking at how many world championships have been won, or who won what
          against who, it gets a bit complicated. Some experts argue that a
          player such as Jose Capablanca, who dominated the game in the early
          20th century with his positional play and endgame prowess, others say
          its Kasparov, for his aggressive and somewhat creative play style,
          while also winning the most championships, tied with Anatoly Karpov,
          and Emanuel Lasker, Bobby Fischer, for his incredible analytical
          skills, and deep understanding of the game, winning the championship
          in 1972, Anatoly Karpov, known for his consistency in winning his
          games, with his impressive tournament victories record. <br /><br /> <p> <i>Random Chess Fact #02: Garry Kasparov held the top spot in the FIDE world rankings for 255 months </i> </p>
          <br />However, 2013 marked a dramatically significant turning
          point for Chess as one player stood out from the rest in almost every
          way, from his exceptional tactical and positional play, ability to
          find creative solutions in near impossible positions, second youngest
          chess champion of all time, aquired the highest ever FIDE rating in
          all of Chess, standing at 2882, surpassing even Garry Kasparovs prime.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Magnus Carlsen</b>, in a complete league of his own, 5 consecutive
          FIDE World Championships, four-time Rapid Chess champion, and six-time
          Blitz Chess champion, holding the number 1 position since 2011 holding
          the record for longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical
          Chess. <br />
          <br />A Chess prodigy, Carlsen earned the grandmaster title at the age
          of 13, and at 15 won the Norweigen Chess Championship, and at 17 joint
          first in the top group of Corus, surpassing a rating of 2800 at 18,
          and finally at 19 he reached number 1 in the FIDE world rankings.
          Shortly after his win against Viswanathan Anand for the World Chess
          Champion title, he won both the Rapid, and Blitz championships, being
          the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, he then did
          this two more times in the coming years.
