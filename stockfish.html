        <h1>Stockfish - Chess Engine</h1>
        <p>
          Stockfish is one of the most popular chess engines in the world. It is
          a free and open-source chess engine that is used by many chess
          players, programmers, and chess enthusiasts around the world.
          Stockfish is a chess engine that is designed to analyze and play chess
          games at a very high level. It is used by many chess players as a
          training tool and to analyze their own games. The engine is also used
          in computer chess competitions to test its performance against other
          chess engines. <br /><br />
          Stockfish was first created in 2008 by Tord Romstad, Marco Costalba,
          and Joona Kiiski. It is based on another open-source chess engine
          called Glaurung, which was also developed by Tord Romstad. Stockfish
          was created as a result of the frustration of the developers with the
          commercial chess engine programs that were available at that time. The
          aim was to create a high-quality chess engine that was free and
          open-source. Stockfish has gone through several versions since its
          creation in 2008. The current version of Stockfish is Stockfish 15.1,
          as of January 2023, Stockfish 15.1 achieved a FIDE rating of 3582,
          making it the strongest chess engine in the world. <br /><br />
          Stockfish has achieved many breakthroughs over the years. In 2013,
          Stockfish won the TCEC Season 6 Superfinal, which was a major
          achievement for the engine. The TCEC is a computer chess tournament
          that is considered to be one of the most prestigious computer chess
          tournaments in the world. In the same year, Stockfish won the
          Chess.com Computer Chess Championship, which is another major computer
          chess tournament. Stockfish has won many other computer chess
          tournaments since then.

        <p>
          If you are interested in the technical stuff.. Stockfish can use up to
          1024 CPU threads in multiprocessor systems. The maximal size of its
          transposition table is 32TB. Stockfish has been developing and tested
          on a framework called <i>Fishtest </i>, where volunteers can donate
          CPU time for tetsing and improvements for thie program. The various
          changes to the game playing code are accepted or rejected based on the
          results of tens of thousands of games on the framework against an
          older "reference" version of the program, utilising sequential
          probability ratio testing. The <i>chi-squared test</i> is used to
          verify the tests on the framework, only if the results are deemed
          statistically significant are they reliable and used in the software
          code.

          The Top Chess Engine Championship, or TCEC for short, is an annual
          competition where the world's strongest chess engines compete against
          each other to determine the best chess engine of the year. The
          championship has been held since 2010 and has become one of the most
          prestigious events in the computer chess world. One engine that has
          consistently performed well in the TCEC is Stockfish. Stockfish is a
          free, open-source chess engine that was first released in 2008. It was
          created by Tord Romstad, Marco Costalba, and Joona Kiiski, and is
          based on the Glaurung chess engine. Since its release, Stockfish has
          become one of the strongest chess engines in the world and is used by
          many players and chess enthusiasts to analyze games and improve their
          skills. <br /><br />

          One of the reasons why Stockfish is so strong is its ability to
          analyze positions deeply and accurately. The engine uses a combination
          of sophisticated algorithms and powerful hardware to evaluate
          positions and find the best moves. Additionally, Stockfish's search
          function is optimized to quickly explore the most promising
          variations, allowing it to quickly identify the strongest moves in a
          given position. Over the years, Stockfish has achieved several
          breakthroughs in the computer chess world. In 2014, the engine
          achieved a perfect score in the annual Chess.com Computer Chess
          Championship, winning all of its games and defeating other top engines
          such as Komodo and Houdini. In 2016, Stockfish played a series of
          matches against GM Hou Yifan, one of the strongest female chess
          players in the world, and won all four games. <br /><br />

          In terms of estimated FIDE rating, Stockfish 14 is currently rated at
          around 3600, making it one of the strongest chess engines in history.
          This is significantly higher than the current human world champion,
          Magnus Carlsen, who is rated at around 2840. It's important to note,
          however, that FIDE ratings for chess engines are not directly
          comparable to human ratings, as they are based on different criteria. <br><br>
