        <h2>The Pieces</h2>
        <p>
          Chess is a game of strategy and tactics that has been played for
          centuries. With a rich history and numerous variations, chess is a
          game that challenges players' minds and requires them to think
          critically about their every move. One of the key aspects of chess is
          the vast array of tactics that players can use to outmaneuver their
          opponents. From simple moves to complex strategies, there are
          countless ways to approach the game of chess. In this article, we will
          explore the tactics of chess by examining each individual chess piece
          and what it does on the board. <br /><br />
          But first, lets go over the pieces and how they move.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b> pawn </b>is the most numerous piece on the board, and it has
          the least mobility of all the pieces. Pawns can only move forward, and
          they can only capture diagonally. However, pawns are essential for
          controlling the center of the board and creating a defensive barrier
          for other pieces. Pawns also have the unique ability to promote to any
          other piece when they reach the opposite side of the board.
          <br /><br />
          The <b> knight </b> is a unique piece that moves in an L-shape. It is
          the only piece that can jump over other pieces, and it is an excellent
          piece for attacking and defending. Knights can be tricky to use
          effectively, but they are powerful when placed in the right position.
          <br /><br />
          The <b> bishop </b> is a piece that moves diagonally and is a potent
          attacking piece. Bishops are most effective when they have a clear
          diagonal to move along, and they can be used to control entire
          sections of the board. <br /><br />
          The <b> rook </b> is a powerful piece that moves horizontally and
          vertically. It is the most significant attacking piece in the game,
          and it can be used to control entire rows and columns of the board.
          Rooks are most effective when they are placed on open files, where
          they can attack multiple squares. <br /><br />
          The <b> queen </b> is the most powerful piece on the board, and it can
          move in any direction. The queen is a formidable attacking and
          defending piece, and it can be used to control large portions of the
          board. However, the queen is also a target for the opponent, and it is
          important to keep it safe from attack. <br /><br />
          The <b> <i>king</i> </b> is the most important piece on the board, and
          the game is over when it is checkmated. The king can only move one
          square at a time, but it is essential to keep it safe and protected.
          The king can also be used in the endgame as an attacking piece, but it
          is generally best to keep it safe until the later stages of the game.

        <h2>The Basic Stuff</h2>
        <h3>Controlling the Centre</h3>
        <p>
          The ability to control the centre in Chess is vital to having a
          winning position and good piece development, it allows for greater
          mobility and flexibility in ones position. By occupying and
          controlling the central squares of the board, a player can more easily
          move their pieces to attack and defend various parts of the board.
          Additionally, controlling the center helps to limit the opponent's
          options and restrict their movements, making it more difficult for
          them to mount an effective attack or defense. Good piece development
          is also crucial for controlling the center, as it allows a player to
          bring their pieces into the game and use them to exert pressure on the
          opponent's position. <br />
          <br />
          Some of the most used, and best moves for controlling the centre in
          early games, are the moves pawn to d4 / e5, for white, and d5 / e5 for
          black. As well as knight to c3 and f3 for white, and knight to c6 and
          f6 for black. The knight and the pawn are the only pieces that you can
          move on the first move in a Chess game.
        </p>
        <h3>Piece Development</h3>
        <p>
          Piece development is a fundamental aspect of chess strategy. Players
          should aim to develop their pieces quickly and efficiently, moving
          pawns and pieces from their starting positions to active squares where
          they can control the board. A key component of piece development is
          controlling the center of the board, which allows players to more
          easily move their pieces to attack and defend various parts of the
          board. <br /><br />Basic examples of piece development: <br /><br />
          Moving the pawns in front of the king and queen to open up lines of
          attack for the bishops and knights. <br />
          <br />
          Developing the knights to control the center of the board and threaten
          the opponent's pieces. <br /><br />
          Developing the bishops to control long diagonals and put pressure on
          the opponent's position. <br /><br />
          Moving the queen to an active square where it can support the
          development of other pieces and attack the opponent's pieces.
          <br /><br />
          Castling to safety the king and bring the rooks into the game,
          allowing them to control open files and attack the opponent's
          position.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <i
            >Random Chess Fact #05: Knights are the only piece that can jump
            over other pieces, making them particularly useful for
            development</i
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Tactical opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          Tactical opportunities are another important aspect of chess strategy.
          By looking for opportunities to attack two or more pieces at once, or
          force the opponent to move a valuable piece out of position, players
          can gain a material or positional advantage. Some common tactical
          opportunities in chess include forks, pins, and skewers. A fork occurs
          when one piece attacks two or more pieces at once, while a pin occurs
          when a valuable piece is immobilized by a less valuable piece. A
          skewer is a tactic in which a piece attacks two pieces in a line,
          forcing the more valuable piece to move out of the way.
        </p>

          alt="fork"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <br />
        Here we can see that the knight on e4 has forked whites king and queen,
        as this is a check, the king is forced to move, therefore the knight can
        take the queen. <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="/media/pin.PNG"
          alt="fork"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <br />
        Here we can see that the bishop on b3 is pinning the queen to the king
        on e6, the queen is only able to take the bishop to remove the pin, in
        which blacks queen is then able to win the queen and deliver checkmate
        shortly after. <br />
        <p>
          <br />
          <img
            src="/media/skewer.PNG"
            alt="fork"
            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
          />
          <br />
          Here we can see that the bishop on e5 is skewering the king and rook,
          eventually winning a rook, this is because the king is more valueable
          than the rook, and therefore forced to move at the threat of a bishop,
          black wins the rook.<br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          <i
            >Random Chess Fact #06: The longest a Chess game could last, in
            theory is 5,949 moves, due to a rule in which a draw can be made if
            50 moves are made with no captures or pawn moves.</i

        <h3>Plan Ahead</h3>
        <p>
          Planning ahead is crucial for creating a successful strategy in chess.
          By thinking ahead and anticipating the opponent's moves, players can
          create a plan to control key areas of the board or launch an attack on
          the opponent's king. A key component of planning ahead is creating a
          long-term strategy and setting goals for the game. This may involve
          identifying weak points in the opponent's position, creating pawn
          chains to control key areas of the board, or developing a piece to
          launch an attack.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/media/plan1.PNG"
          alt="fork"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <p>
          Here we have a game started off with white pawn to e4, black pawn to
          e5, standard developing moves
        </p>
        <img
          src="/media/plan2.PNG"
          alt="fork"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <p>
          both players decide to bring their knights out for additional
          development, allowing for each piece to gain a good amount of active
          moves and be useful as a piece.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/media/plan3.PNG"
          alt="fork"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <p>
          Whites knight on c3 moves to b 5 in the hopes of gaining an advantage
          of black by using one of the tactics meantioned in the tactical
          opportunities section, the fork. This fork in particular would put the
          king in check and white would win a rook, however white needs to make
          a very specific move for it to work.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/media/plan4.PNG"
          alt="fork"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <p>
          e7.. a blunder from white, resulting in the loss of a rook, this
          tactic is very popualr amongst chess players.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/media/plan5.PNG"
          alt="fork"
          style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"
        />
        <p>
          The knight takes its chance and moves to c7 putting the king in check,
          forcing black to do the only move it can king to d8, allowing the
          knight to win a rook straight away in the early game - see, this is
          the importance of thinkning ahead.
        </p>
